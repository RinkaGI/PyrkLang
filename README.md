# PyrkLang: Get the best coding experience!

project is only starting!

## How to run
### Interpreter
You should have your script (script.pyrk) and in the same directory all pyrklang files, for running this repo, you should do python3 ./PyrkLang/interpreter.py helloworld.pyrk

### Compiler
I recommend you to use the scheme of this repo for the dirs
You must have installed nasm, gcc and use Windows x86_64

Same as interpreter but with compiler file

## Documentation
print -> built-in function, it can only receive a string or a number ex: print "hello world"

## some extra info
interpreting is fastest than compiling, but executing a compiled script is fastest that interpret a file.
so i recommend you use the interpreter for developing and compiler for distributing
